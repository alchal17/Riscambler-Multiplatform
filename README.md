language based on **RISC-V** Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), made by
<del>former</del> 2nd year students at the Ukrainian Catholic University
during "Computer Systems Architectures" course.

## Features
- RV32I ISA support
- Tools for running and debugging assembly code
- process visualization

### Planned
- Finish UI
- Implement the debugger and visualisation tools
- Provide sufficient testing
- Update logical block of instructions to avoid using built-in `shl/shr` methods
- Finish runner to execute written code
### Finished
- Integrate the [RISC-V Translator](https://github.com/ansuzcoder/risc-translator) into the application
- Implemented arithmetic instructions
- Finish the remaining instructions
